# Bitcoin-Trading

# Overview
Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus "chained" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred.
As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow. Included here is historical bitcoin market data at 1-min intervals for select bitcoin exchanges where trading takes place. At times, there exist a minute that no transaction occur, of which transactions information would be filled with nan.

# Objective
The main goal of this hackathon is to classify whether you should buy Bitcoin now or not. This is captured by the signal column in the dataset. Files for select bitcoin exchanges for the time period of Jan 2012 to December March 2021, every time a transaction occurs, are available. Timestamps are in Unix time. 

Your submission file should be a CSV file with two columns (see example in sample_submission.csv):
- Timestamp: timestamp of the exchange
- signal: prediction for the signal, 1 or 0 (to buy or not to buy)

A dataset spread over several data sources has been provided for you. The total number of features is plentiful and it’s up to you to use as many or as little as you want. Given that, some features might be more relevant than others. 

Keeping in mind that this is a Data Wrangling specialization. Therefore, don’t feel intimidated by the provided features, and its level of required financial knowledge. We have provided you with a utils function. You can use it to further understand the provided features, or use it to generate extra features. Make good use of them.

## The dataset contains these features:
- Timestamp: Time when the transaction occurred in Unix time.
- Open: Opening price of bitcoin for each interval of one minute
- High: Highest price of bitcoin for each interval of one minute
- Low: Lowest price of bitcoin for each interval of one minute
- Close: Closing price of bitcoin at the current time point.
- Volume_(BTC): Total volume of bitcoin transactions for each interval of one minute, expressed in BTC
- Volume_(Currency): Total volume of bitcoin transactions for each interval of one minute), expressed in fiat currency
- Signal: This is the target. Signal indicates if the short term price at this time point has gone up compared to the long term price, and therefore you should buy - - BTC (signal=1). On the other hand, signal = 0 indicates short-term price has gone down and you should not buy (signal=0).
- Moving Average (MA): A moving average provides an indication of the trend of the price movement by cutting down the amount of "noise" on a price chart.
- Exponential moving average (EMA): A variation of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
- Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D): A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. %K and %D are slow and fast indicators.
If the indicator is above 80, it is considered as overbought. If the indicator is below 20, it is considered as oversold. Analyst looks for signals when both %K & %D are both above 80 or below 20
- Momentum (MOM): It is the rate of acceleration of a security's price or volume – that is, the speed at which the price is changing.
- Relative Strength Index (RSI): It is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.
- Rate Of Change (ROC): It is a momentum oscillator, which measures the percentage change between the current price and the n period past price.


# Data Sources
The data is distributed across multiple data sources, otherwise, what’s the point of a data wrangling hackathon. ;) 
## Files
In the data folder, you’ll find:
- a collection of 4 files, in different formats:
- data_0, data_1, data_2, data_3
## The test set:
- test.csv
Also, a sample submission, containing the timestamp and the predicted signal:
- sample_submission.csv
